# Predictive Pedestrian Detection in Autonomous Driving Using Traditional Korean Mask Dance (Talchum) Motion Data 🇰🇷🎭🕺


### 📌 Project Overview

Predicting unexpected pedestrian behavior is essential for safe autonomous driving. This project leverages complex motion patterns from **Talchum (traditional Korean mask dance) data to build a model that can predict non-standard pedestrian behavior**
, which is often missed by conventional pedestrian datasets. By combining YOLO with a keypoint-based detection system, this project aims to enable autonomous vehicles to respond more swiftly and accurately to unpredictable pedestrian actions.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Complex Motion Learning:** Learns various movement patterns in Talchum, enhancing the model's ability to detect unusual pedestrian behavior.
- **YOLO & Keypoint-based Risk Detection:** Uses YOLO for pedestrian location detection and keypoints for anticipating sudden movements.

### 📊 Data Processing & Analysis
Key and Keypoint Analysis: Visualizes the relationships between height and keypoints using vector flow and heatmaps to understand movement patterns.
Correlation Analysis: Shows correlations between height and keypoints for deeper insight into pedestrian behaviors.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing, model training, and analysis.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud environment for training and experimentation.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Primary tool for bounding box-based object detection.
- **OpenCV**: Used for computer vision processing and keypoint analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization, heatmaps, and flow mapping.
