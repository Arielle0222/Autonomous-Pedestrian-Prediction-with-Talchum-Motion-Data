# Predicting Sudden Pedestrian Behavior in Autonomous Vehicles Using Complex Talchum Dance Data
Leveraging traditional Korean Talchum dance data, this project enhances pedestrian prediction models for autonomous vehicles by capturing complex, non-standard movement patterns. Integrating YOLO and keypoint detection, it aims to improve response to sudden and unpredictable pedestrian actions.
