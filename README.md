# Autonomous-Pedestrian-Prediction-with-Talchum-Motion-Data
Leveraging traditional Korean Talchum dance data, this project enhances pedestrian prediction models for autonomous vehicles by capturing complex, non-standard movement patterns. Integrating YOLO and keypoint detection, it aims to improve response to sudden and unpredictable pedestrian actions.
